               <b>Hello, my name is Stephen Gilbert.</b> Welcome to the Orange Coast
               College CS 150 information page. We are offering four sections
               of CS 150 this semester. This is the syllabus for the two
               <b>live-online</b> sections which I'll be teaching. We are
               also offering <a href="index-jj.html">
               two <b>hybrid</b> sections of the class</a>, taught
               by Dr. Justin Jang.
            </p>
            <p>CS 150 is a <b>second semester</b> programming class for 
               Computer Science and Engineering majors who intend to transfer 
               to a 4-year university. To enroll in CS 150 you
                must first complete CS 170 (Java Programming) here at OCC,
                <i>or</i> apply for a prerequisite waiver. You'll find
                more information on the prerequisite below.

    <h3>Prerequisites
    </h3>
        <p> At OCC <b>prerequisites are enforced</b> for Computer Science classes.
            You can be cleared in the registration system for enforced
            Prerequisites and Co-Requisites in one of three ways:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>You must complete (with a "C" or better) the
                <i>introductory</i> computer programming class we offer
                here at OCC: <b>CS 170</b> (Java Programming). 
                You cannot take CS 150 concurrently with
                the prerequisite class.
            </li>
            <li>You may successfully complete an <b>equivalent</b> course
                with a "C" or better at another regionally accredited college
                or university, and submit transcripts to verify successful
                completion. You may submit unofficial transcripts for prerequisite
                clearance, but must submit official transcripts if you wish to
                transfer the course units to OCC. If you believe that you have
                completed the OCC course prerequisite at another college,
                submit a
                <a href='https://www.orangecoastcollege.edu/student_services/counseling/Documents/FORMOCCPre_CorequisiteEquivalencyRequest.pdf'

        <h3>What's CS 150 <i>Really</i> About?
         </h3>
        <p> Computer Science 150 is a course in computer programming that uses the
            ANSI/ISO C++ programming language to teach <i>structured and
            object-based programming techniques</i>.
        </p>
        <p>There are several reasons why you might want to take CS 150:
        </p><ul>
            <li>If you intend to major in Computer Science, the C++ programming is widely
                used as the language for operating systems and embedded programming
                courses. Some universities use C++ as the primary teaching language
                for all of their courses.
            </li>
            <li>If you want to learn the advanced object-oriented and generic programming
                features of the C++ language, you should first learn the basic syntax of C++. CS
                150 gives you a solid foundation in C++ syntax, control structures, and
                fundamental data types.
            </li>
            <li>If you want to write high-performance programs for Windows or Unix.
                It's good to know C++, even if you eventually program in Python
                or C#. Both Unix and Windows have the C/C++ language at its core.
            </li>
            <li>You want to go into game programming. High-performance games are
                almost always written in C++, and, if you transfer into a 4-year
                gaming program, like the CGS program at UCI, you'll need to know
                C++.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> A computer programming course really has two parts. The first part is simply
            learning the syntax or grammar that a particular language uses. You need
            to learn the specific keywords and control structures used by each language,
            as well as the common idioms used to express generic computer algorithms.
        </p>
        <p> 
            The second part, however, is really more interesting. At its heart,
            a course in computer programming is a course in <i>thinking</i> and
            <i>problem solving</i>. It is also a lot of fun. Fred Brooks, the
            father of modern software engineering, lists five reasons why
            programming is fun:
        </p>
             <img src='images/brooks.jpg' class='right shadow' style='margin-left:1em; width:200px;' />
       <ol>
            <li>Because of the sheer joy of making things. "As the child delights in his
                mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his
                own design."</li>
            <li>Because of the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people.</li>
            <li>Because of the fascination of building complex, puzzle-like objects. "The
                programmed computer has all the fascination of the pinball machine or the
                jukebox mechanism, carried to the ultimate."</li>
            <li>Because of the joy of always learning new things. Programming is ever new.</li>
            <li>Because of the delight of working in such a tractable medium. As Brooks
                put it:
                <blockquote>
                <p>
                The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from
                pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating
                by exertion of the imagination...Yet the program construct, unlike the
                poet's words, is real in the sense that it moves and works, producing visible
                outputs separate from the construct itself. It prints results, draws pictures,
                produces sounds, moves arms. The magic of myth and legend has come true
                in our time. One types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display
                screen comes to life, showing things that never were nor could be.
                </p><p>
                Programming then is fun because it gratifies creative longings built
                deep within us and delights sensibilities we have in common with all men.
                </p><p>
                &nbsp;&nbsp;--Frederick P. Brooks, Jr, The Mythical Man Month, 2nd Ed.
                </p>
                </blockquote>
            </li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Goals and Outcomes
    </h3>
        <p> The ANSI/ISO C++ programming language is a <b><i>multi-paradigm</i></b>
            language. That means it can be used to write computer programs using several
            different <i>methodologies or techniques</i>. In this course, C++ Programming I,
            you will:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Begin by writing <i>imperative</i>, <i>procedural</i> or
                <i>structured</i> programs.
            </li>
            <li>You'll also learn how to write <i>object-based</i>
            and <i>object-oriented</i> programs.
            </li>
            <li>You'll learn about the syntax and
            semantics of the C++ language, as well as many of the common "idioms" used by
            C and C++ programmers, especially those that are different from those
            used in other programming languages.
            <li>You will learn how to use
            pointers and how to employ recursion.
            </li>
            <li> Finally, you will also be introduced
            to the C++ Standard Template Library (<b>STL</b>) through the
            <code>string</code> and <code>vector</code> classes.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p> In CS 250, (C++ Programming II, the course that follows this course), you
            will study more advanced object-oriented and generic programming methods,
            learn to implement basic data structures, such as linked lists and binary
            trees, and learn more about the C++ Standard Template Library. You'll also learn
            to use the <b>functional</b> LISP programming dialect called <b>Scheme</b>
            (or <b>Racket</b>).
        </p>
        <p> To help you <mark>master</mark> these programming techniques, you will be writing
            <b>a lot</b> of programs. Each week you will work on several 
            <i>discussion exercises</i> during class, along with lecture. Along with
            the weekly reading, you'll complete short programming exercises along
            with the reading. Finally, each week you will complete several programing 
            homework assignments, and take a reading quiz to assess your understanding.  
        </p>
        <p> It is important that you <i><b>actually do</b></i> the homework and
            reading exercises. In addition I encourage you to write small programs
            on your own to explore the language. You <b>cannot</b> passively absorb
            the material, and expect to pass the class; you must "learn by doing".
        </p>
        <p> The purpose of these programming assignments&#8212;and the goals of the course&#8212;are
            that you:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Understand and can apply the basic concepts of structured programming.</li>
            <li>Can use modern C++ programming tools to produce computer programs written
                in the C++ programming language.</li>
            <li>Understand and can apply the syntax and semantics of the C++ programming
                language.</li>
            <li>Gain experience in writing programs, thereby developing skills in program
                design, coding, and debugging, as well as developing critical thinking
                and reasoning skills.</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Outcomes </h3>
        <p>Upon successful completion of the course, you will be able to:
        </p><ul>
            <li>Apply structured and object-oriented programming techniques to
                solve various problems using
                the C++ programming language.</li>
            <li>Produce programs correctly using each of the different flow-of-control
                constructs.</li>
            <li>Produce programs which show an understanding of how to pass data between
                different modules without resorting to global variables.</li>
            <li>Demonstrate skills in using different forms of arrays and structures to
                solve problems.</li>
            <li>Design and implement programs that use sequential and random file concepts.</li>
            <li>Differentiate between the different data storage classes used in C++ programs.</li>
            <li>Apply the concept of structures to solve various problems.</li>
            <li>Compare and contrast the different fundamental data structures used in
                Computer Science.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>The <b>Student Learning Outcomes</b> or CSLOs for CS 150 describe things
            you are expected to be <b>able to do</b>. After completing this class
            you'll be able to:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use C++ to solve various problems that incorporate the use of correct
                data types, arrays, vectors, loops, branching, operators, functions,
                recursion, dynamic memory allocation and sequential file I/O concepts.
            </li>
            <li>Use C++ to solve various problems that use object-oriented methodology
                by defining classes and using inheritance and polymorphism.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p> Your mastery of these CSLOs will be assessed by a series of hands-on programming exams.</p>
    <h2 id="how">How can you succeed in CS 150?
        <a class='label label-top' href='#top'><i class='icon-white icon-chevron-up'></i></a>
    </h2>
            classes you may have taken. In a "traditional" classroom,
            you come to class and listen to me talk about a particular
            topic for an hour or two. If you're like me, you often won't
            <i>really</i> understand the material once the lecture is over. To master
            each topic, you go home, read the textbook, and try and
            make sense of all of the "hard stuff".
            <img src='images/lecture1.png' class='centered'>
            Then, to see if you <b>know</b> the hard stuff, you complete
            several programming assignments (homework). Finally, to show
            me that you've mastered the material, I give you an exam.
        </p>
        <p> <img src='images/yoda.png' class='right'>
            Of course, this is the way that college courses have worked <b>since the
            middle ages</b>. Since then, though, there
            have been some <b>great</b> innovations.  First, we had the printing press,
            so that knowledge could be encoded in books; you no longer had to
            "Trust the Monk" for every piece of information.
        </p>
        <p> With Amazon, you can purchase "knowledge"
            and have it downloaded to your Kindle or delivered to your door in a day.
            What that means is, you don't have to try and find an expert in
            a topic; you can <b>read a book</b> and analyze it <b>yourself</b>.
            If all that happens in lecture is that I summarize or re-phrase
            what is said in the book, what purpose does that serve?
        </p>
        <p> This "traditional" way of teaching makes it pretty easy for me to <b>teach</b> the
            class, but it's really not the best way for you to <b>learn</b>
            the material. That's because the only time you really interact with
            me (the "expert" after all), is when you don't know enough to
            ask any questions. By the time you get to the hard stuff, you're
            on your own.
        </p>
        <h3>Moving to the 21<sup>st</sup> Century Classoom</h3>
        <p> In this class, we we'll do things a little bit differently. My goal is to
            give you more opportunities to get feedback on your learning from the
            "expert" (that's me <img src='images/smiley.gif' style='vertical-align:top;'>).
        </p>
        <p> Since you are intelligent, and you can buy access to the basics of
            the knowledge needed for this class in the form of the textbook, I'll
            ask you to get your <b>first exposure</b> to the material by
            <b>reading the book</b> (or other assigned resources) and gaining an
            understanding of the "basics" for yourself.
        </p>
        <p> To help you out, I'll provide you with a set of self-check questions in
        	the form of a pre-lecture quiz that must be completed before each
        	lecture section. Here's what our revised model looks like:
            <img src='images/lecture2.png' class='centered'>
            Now, you might be wondering "why a quiz before the lecture?"
            There are a few reasons:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>It gives you an excuse to read the book and do the homework. 
                I know that all of your are busy people, and by giving you 
                "points" for taking the quiz and doing the homework, I'm giving you 
                and incentive to fit class preparation into your busy schedule.
            </li>
            <li> You should ACE every quiz. Quizzes are over the <b>basic</b> information
                from the textbook&mdash;getting all the questions on the quiz right let's
                you know you learned enough from reading to engage and learn in "lecture".
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p> During lecture, I'll be presenting some of the "hard stuff" which
            students often struggle with or which the book doesn't explain in
            detail. (After all, I do have years of experience with students 
            making the same mistakes over and over again.) Sometimes I will "explain things" 
            in a way that looks like lecture, but much of the time, I will be letting you
            <b>test your understanding</b> and deepen your understanding&mdash;by
            presenting a question for you to solve, and having you discuss it in a
            team of your peers, to make sure you really <b>do</b> get it.
        </p>
        <p> Instead of using "clickers" to answer these questions (which are physical
            devices you have to purchase and remember to bring to class), we'll be using
            a software program which you can access from your
            class computer. For each question I ask, you will vote on your answer, so I
            can adapt what we do in class to address issues you are not sure about.
        </p>
        <p> Finally in lab and with homework, you'll have a chance to practice your
            mastery of the material. And then, I'll let you show me how much you have
            mastered by taking several <b>proficiency exams</b>.
        </p>
        <div class='summary'>
             <img src='images/learning-cycle.png' class='right' style='width:30%'>
        <p>
            This process is based around giving you the opportunity to get access
            to expert help and explanation, <b>when you need it</b>; not leaving
            you alone at night when you are doing your homework.
        </p>
        <p> It is also based in research on "how people learn".
            Researchers have shown
            that people each construct their own understanding&mdash;individually.
            It's not really possible for me to "dump" or transmit understanding
            into your brain. Each of you is a unique individual, and you will
            each need to <b>work and construct your own understanding</b>.
        </p>
        </div>
      <h3>How much time will you have to spend on CS 150?</h3>
        <p>
           	Everybody learns in different ways and at different speeds.
            CS 150 is a 4-unit class, designed to take 216 hours to complete,
            (if you want a B/C) grade. This works out to about <mark>14.5 hours a
            week</mark>. You'll spend five of those hours live-online with
            your instructor, which leave you with about 9.5 hours on your own.
            If you're a good student or you're satisfied with a lower grade,
            you may get by with less. If you have difficulty with the
            material, or if you want to receive an A in the course, you'll
            probably have to spend more time.
        </p>
        <p> You'll find that the material in CS 150 is <mark>very sequential</mark>.
            You can't really succeed by staying up all night every Sunday. Instead,
            you need to budget your time. Spend a couple hours every day, one hour 
            reading the text, and one hour working on the exercises and
            homework assignments. Spreading out your time will really help you
            to absorb the material better and quicker. For most students, the best way 
            to learn to program is to actually write programs. 
        </p>
    <h3>Reading</h3>
        <p> <mark>Six reading lessons</mark> will be assigned for each week in the class,
            except for those weeks when a midterm exam is given. In those cases you'll have two
            weeks to complete the reading. Each lesson is accompanied by a set of
            short, hands-on <mark>exercises</mark>. You <b>must</b> read the lessons and 
            do the exercises <b>before</b> the next live-online lecture. 
        </p>
        <p> Your instructor will <mark>preview</mark> the topics covered in the next
            set of lessons, but <mark>will not</mark> "read the textbook" to you. 
            To make sure you've read the lessons, each week you will complete a <mark>reading quiz</mark>
            which you'll answer on Canvas. You will normally have 30 minutes to answer 30 questions. 
            (The short time is to make sure you are answering the questions
            based on your reading, and not looking up the answers.) You can take each quiz twice,
            and your highest score is recorded.
        </p>
    <h3>Programming &amp; Written Examinations</h3>
        <p> Programming is a <b>skill to be mastered</b>. To make sure that you've mastered
            the programming topics, you'll take <b>ten</b> hands-on programming exams.
            These are closed-book, closed-notes, programming exams where you will be
            asked to demonstrate your proficiency with different aspects of C++.
       </p>
        <p> You will have 45 minutes for each exam, strictly timed. The programming exams
            will be given during the scheduled live-online class meetings and
            <mark>may be proctored</mark>.
        </p>
        <p> There will also be <b>four written exams&#8212;three midterms and a final</b>.
            The written exams may have both multiple-choice questions as well as short-answer
            and fill-in type questions. The written exams will be given on the computer.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The written exams are closed-notes, closed book.</li>
            <li>You'll have one hour for each midterm and two hours for the final.</li>
            <li>The final exam is comprehensive.</li>
            <li>You <b>must</b> take the final to pass the class.</li>
            <li>There are no makeups for the written exams.</li>
        </ul>
        <p> If your final exam percentage grade is greater than your
            average midterm exam percentage, then the final exam (percentage) score will
            replace your midterm score.
        </p>
        <p> All exams will take place during the regular "live-online" class session
            and <mark>may be proctored</mark>.
        </p>
    <h3>What about programming assignments?</h3>
        <p><img src='images/tuba.png' class='right' alt='How not to learn the tuba.'>
            Learning to program is a lot like learning to play the tuba;
            you'll never be any good unless you practice. To help you do
            this, you'll spend <b>most</b> of your out of class time,
            and a portion of each class period, writing programs.
            Each week you'll complete several different programming 
            problems from the material we've covered that week.
        </p>
        <p> You'll complete these programming assignments as you read the
            textbook. Often the textbook will go over the solution,
            so you should be able to get 100% on the homework if you
            put in the time.
        </p>
        <p> You must complete each assignment by its due date.
            You cannot makeup missed homework assignments after the fact.
            (You can work ahead, however.) You'll generally receive a
            with a test program, so you can "grade" yourself after you've
            finished the problem. If you do poorly on a problem, you
            can read through the solution, and then rewrite and re-grade
            your solution. When you rewrite your program, <b>don't</b>
            refer to the posted solution&#8212;that way you'll make sure you
            <b>really understand</b> how to write it.
        </p>
        <p> When you are finished with each homework assignment, you'll 
            submit a "completion code" generated by the test program.
        </p>
    <h3>Class Discussion</h3>
        <p>
            One of the greatest learning resources at your disposal are the
            other students you'll meet in this class. Turning to StackOverflow
            (or Google) for help with your questions is not the best way to
            get them answered. The answer you receive (if any) is often wrong.
            Instead, take advantage of the fact that you have forty (or more)
            students who are facing exactly the same problems, and asking
            exactly the same questions you are asking. 
        </p>
        <p>
            To encourage you to help each other, use the online
            discussion area to ask <b>all of your technical questions</b>, instead
            of sending an email message. Let's keep email for "personal"
            correspondence&#8212;things like "I'll be missing class this Tuesday",
            instead of questions like "Why do I get this error message when
            I compile?" If you ask these types of questions on the discussion
            board, you'll help all the other students who are having the same
            problem, but didn't think to ask. (Your instructor will answer questions posted
            on the discussion board, after your fellow students have had an
            opportunity to respond. Your instructor also reads all of the 
            messages on the discussion board.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Class announcements and general tips will also be posted on the
            discussion board, as well as resources such as slides and starter files. 
            Check the board regularly, (several times each week), for new announcements.
        </p>
        <h3>How will I be graded?</h3>
        <p>
            You may take this course for a grade, or on a P/NP basis.
            If you take the course for pass/no-pass, you must obtain a
            score equivalent to a "C" to get credit. (If you're transferring,
            though, make <b>sure</b> that the institution you're transferring
            <b>to</b> will accept P/NP; most institutions won't if it's
            a requirement for your major.) To receive a P/NP grade, you simply
            make a selection using MyOCC. (You no longer have to go to the
            Admissions and Records office.) However there is still a cutoff
            deadline to make your selection.
        </p>
        <p> <b class='ry'>Cautionary Note</b>: starting in 2019, UCI requires CS admits to get at least a B in
            every lower-division course in the major. If you are a CS major, and you intend to transfer
            to a UC, and you don't have at least a B at the drop deadline, you probably should
            take a W and try again later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Grades will be assigned based on the following weights:
        </p>

            alt='The C++ Primer & the C++ Programming Language.'>
            The reading for this class will be the online lessons from the 
            <b>CS 150 Course Reader</b> which to which will be <b>available for free</b> on Canvas.
               If you want a printed reference text, I recommend two of them.
        </p>
        <p> Stanley Lippmann's <b>C++ Primer</b>,
            5<sup>th</sup> Edition. This covers the features in the new
            C++11 standard. The bookstore will have a few copies of the book; you can also
            get it at Amazon for about $40. 
        </p>
        <p> The definitive reference is Bjarne Stroustrup's <b>C++ Programming Language</b>.
            Make sure you get the 4<sup>th</sup> Edition, which covers C++ 11. 
            On Amazon (today, right before Christmas), it was also $40,
            but I paid $60 for mine earlier in the year. On Piazza, I have 
            a link to an early draft of the first five chapters, which was published separately
            as <i>A Tour of C++</i>. 
        </p>
        <p> For those of you who feel the need for a little refresher, I've also
            posted a link to an alternative CS1 C++ textbook on the Canvas home page.
        </p>
    <h3>Software</h3>
        <p> This semester we will be teaching the course using the UNIX/Linux cloud-based
            servers provided by Harvard's CS50 infrastructure. We be using 
            <b>GitHub Classroom</b> to store your source code. You will be able to log into your 
            workspace from any computer and will not have to have any software installed locally.
        </p>
        <p> You will set up and configure these accounts during the first live-online class session.</p>

    <h2 id="policies">What are the "rules" for this course?
        <a class='label label-top' href='#top'><i class='icon-white icon-chevron-up'></i></a>
    </h2>
        <p>
            I don't accept late work on your homework. You must turn it in
            by the due date. You may turn in quizzes, reading exercises, and
            in-class exercises up to one day late for a penalty of 1% per hour.
            I will provide two "makeup" days (after the midterm and
            after the final) where you can take up to <b>four</b> of the
            programming exams you missed, (or <b>retake</b> those you did poorly
            on.) These makeup exams will be on Fridays at your normal live-online class
            meeting time.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your percentage score on your written final exam is better than your
            combined midterm percentage, I'll "throw out" the midterm score,
            and use your final exam only for calculating the written exam
            portion of your final grade.
        </p>
        <h3>Attendance and Withdrawal</h3>
        <p>
            I will take attendance, and you are expected to be
            in class. If you miss <b>two consecutive weeks of class 
            sessions, you may be dropped
            without notice</b>. Don't assume, though, that you <b>will be</b>
            automatically dropped if you fail to come to class.
            It is your responsibility to withdraw from any class.
            If you stop attending, yet fail to
            withdraw, you will receive a grade of 'F'.
        </p>
        <p>
            Please pay special attention to the
            <a href="http://www.orangecoastcollege.edu/enrollment/Pages/Dates-to-Remember.aspx" target="_blank">
            OCC drop deadlines</a>. Every semester I have students who want
            to drop the class after the deadline to drop has already passed.
            Those students end up getting an 'F' in the class if they are
            unable to complete the coursework.<b>
            I do not give Incomplete grades.</b>
        </p>
        <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
        <p>
            Programming by its nature relies on learning from the work of
            others. You are encouraged to examine each other's code and
            to discuss various approaches and coding styles. You won't really
            learn anything, though, if you don't "try it yourself".
        </p>
        <p>
            In this regard, discussing the general method used to solve
            a problem is certainly encouraged. Taking another student's
            source code and modifying it is really counter-productive;
            you learn to program by working out the programming exercises
            and assignments. If you don't do the assignments yourself,
            you won't learn how to program, and you won't be able to pass
            the programming exams.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to testing time, I expect you to maintain a high
            level of academic honesty. Cheating on exams will result in course
            failure.
        </p>
        <h3>Disruptive Behavior</h3>
        <p>
            You are entitled to an environment that encourages learning,
            as are all your fellow students. You should not behave in a
            manner that negatively impacts other class members. In a
            classroom, such behavior includes hostile behavior such as yelling
            and screaming, as well as interrupting other students and
            attempting to inappropriately dominate the classroom. In our
            "online classroom", disruptive behavior includes "flaming" or
            harassing email, as well as posting offensive material on
            the class discussion board.
        </p>
        <p>
            I expect all of you to be polite, respectful, and helpful to
            your fellow students; in short, I expect you to act like adults
            should act. If, in my judgment, your behavior negatively
            impacts the rest of the class, you may be subject to
            disciplinary action.
        </p>
        <h3>Disabilities</h3>
        <p>
